    Please reach out to me if you’re interested in talking about privacy and security for mental health services. I’m happy to talk with anyone, and I’d like to especially welcome people who have used any sort of mental health services, whether that be speaking to a therapist or psychologist, posting on online message boards, using mental health apps, or anything else.
  </p>

  <p>
    When people talk about their mental health, they often come from a place of vulnerability and sensitivity. So it is natural for them to expect that their conversations be allotted some amount of privacy and security.
  </p>

  <p>
    I know that mental health tools can help people live better lives. I've personally used meditation apps, and I feel that they've helped me maintain a sense of calm. On the other hand, the data that users provide when they use mental health services might not be conferred the privacy that users expect. When people visit a medical office in the US, they can expect that their data will be handled in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which provides protections for data that’s collected by healthcare professionals. Many people have turned to mental health apps, and it may seem like these would operate under similar rules, but some apps operate in a gray area where these rules don’t apply. Even if people read dense privacy policies, the policies may not make it clear how user information could be shared and utilized. Because information about mental health is so sensitive, I believe that users deserve to have a clear understanding of what sharing is going on.
  </p>

  <p>
    The violation of a user’s privacy, despite the user’s expectations, can have a profound impact on someone’s life. Shifting my focus away from mental health apps towards crisis mental health lifelines, people who call the latter are often in very stressful situations. They may be grappling with thoughts of depression or anxiety, and they may urgently need assistance. It is natural for someone in this situation to reach out to a mental health lifeline, but they may not be aware of how the information regarding their situation could be handled. They might not know, for example, that responders may send police if necessary, and that this might result in involuntary hospitalization or institutionalization. Involuntary commitment may make young people less likely to discuss suicidal thoughts in the future, and callers could end up with a large bill for treatment that they didn’t want.
  </p>

  <p>
    I know that mental health services, whatever form it takes, can help people live more authentic and fulfilled lives, helping them achieve their best selves. So much of our society is influenced by how people think, the relationships between people and the information that they share. Given that we live in a society driven by information, I believe that privacy should be a given, especially for topics as sensitive as mental health.
