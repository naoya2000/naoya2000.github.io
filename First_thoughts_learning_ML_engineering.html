  <h1>First thoughts learning ML engineering</h1>

<div id="content">
  <p>
    I started working on the <a href="https://www.redwoodresearch.org/mlab">MLAB curriculum</a> to help new machine
    learning practitioners focused on alignment learn about the subject. There were some things that I realized that may
    be helpful to new learners.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, if you’ve taken math coursework but you still feel like you have a lot of gaps in your knowledge, I recommend
    jumping in even though you feel like you don’t have the necessary skills for whatever it is you want to tackle. I
    took applied math coursework (introductions to probability, statistics, numerical analysis, differential equations)
    when I was in college, but I didn’t always fully understand what I was learning. [1] I believe one failure mode that
    I experienced was the thought pattern that “because I don't thoroughly remember most of the things from my
    university coursework, I'm not prepared to proceed further into ML.” Now, there are a lot of perspectives about
    this, but I found that one approach is to try to learn whatever it is you're learning new (in my case, machine
    learning engineering). Then, whenever you hit a barrier preventing progress, you should try to learn whatever is
    blocking the way by reading stuff and learning. I think it is a shift in tactical approach, moving from "I need to
    learn all the prerequisite material before I start tackling the next phase" to “even if I don't understand all the
    prerequisite material, it is possible for me to fill in the gaps as I go.” Different people probably have different
    styles of learning, but I think many people will make much faster progress if they try to review or learn important
    things whilst they’re working on the key goal at hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note, however, that I’m not saying that it’s a good idea to start learning about machine learning without having
    taken the prerequisite coursework. You may not be able to remember each definition, theorem and proof from your math
    coursework, but there are certain themes that you will pick up from your math coursework that inform what you’re
    currently studying. For example, reading through this explanation from <a
      href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BatchNorm2d.html">the documentation for BatchNorm2d</a>,
    I am familiar with the concept of “expected value” and “biased and unbiased estimators”. I may not remember every
    single detail, such as the justification for dividing by (n - 1) for sample standard deviation, but I feel
    comfortable looking up these concepts and refreshing myself. I don’t know how often people run into this trap of
    feeling like you need to know everything, but I honestly feel that the main purpose of prerequisites is to provide
    you with the background and themes that you need to learn about new content.

      documentation</a></p>
  <p>
    The second thing that I realized is how normal it is to feel confused or get stuck on whatever you're working on.
    The first time that I came across the concept of a convolution from <a
      href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html">the Conv2d documentation</a>, I could not
    easily conceptualize what the idea was about.

  <p>
    I think that this might be a skill that I gained from the “math of machine learning” course that I took last year,
    where I often felt that I was surrounded by ambiguity. I’ve found that when you’re first learning a new concept in
    math, it can be helpful to think about the simplest possible case.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thinking about the above example with Conv2d, I tried to think about what happens when N = 1 and C_in = 1. OK, we
    have one item in our batch which consists of one channel. Then, because we also have H and W dimensions, we can
    think of this as a “2D region” with certain values in our channel. For adding another channel to the existing one, I
    thought of this as creating another “2D region” that had some sort of relationship to the existing one. For example,
    if we were to have three channels, this could represent the RGB color model, with each channel representing one of
    red, green or blue. So overall, a batch of one item with three channels could be thought of as a color picture. Then
    having a batch of two or more items with three channels can be thought of as having multiple color pictures.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is likely a skill that math majors are comfortable with to some extent, but I thought it is worth pointing out
    because the inclination to look at the simplest case is not something that I’ve always had. There have been times in
    college math where I didn’t even want to start working on a problem because I thought that it was so complicated.
    Harnessing this skill, adopting an attitude of “what actions might get me closer to my desired result” over “what is
    the right action” and being willing to look at problems with fresh eyes over and over will help.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lastly, I want to discuss starting points for working on machine learning. I think that learning about machine
    learning from an engineering perspective could be more useful than tackling it from a theoretical perspective, at
    least for some people. My naive perspective is that machine learning engineering can offer much more clear progress
    and feedback loops compared to learning about theory. For example, it is often quick to tell if a function in Python
    is working properly and not having errors. On the other hand, reading through proofs that you’ve written for errors
    or edge cases can take a few or more minutes of close reading and analysis. Even for people who want to tackle
    theory, I think ML engineering may be the best place to begin from.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m still hard at work learning about ML engineering. I want to continue building my skills and my provisional goal
    is to get to a position where I’ll be able to replicate papers. I hope to write more regularly about my progress,
    and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
  </p>

    Footnote 1: You can never know a counterfactual, but I always wonder how my math understanding would have been
    different if I had started college as an applied math major. (In my case, I started as a biological sciences major,
    then around the second year, I changed to applied math.)
